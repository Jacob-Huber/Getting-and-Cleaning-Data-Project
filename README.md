# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Course 3 - Project

I used the X_train and X_test txt files and read them into their own data tables
This was done with the training and test variables

Next I merged the data and then used the merged data to create a new variable gyro
This new variable was then written as a text file named Run_tidy.txt
